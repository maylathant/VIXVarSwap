# VIX and Variance Swap Research Project

The file, "engine.py," launches a demo that showcases some of the tools built for a research project which analyzed VIX and Variance swap strategies. Simply enter a numeric input to run a computation and the results will be plotted for you.

## Needed packages
- matplotlib==2.1.0
- numpy==1.16.4
- scikit-learn==0.19.1
- scipy==1.0.0
- yfinance==0.1.42 (For reference data)
- pandas==0.24.2

## The Options for the Demo include:

1. Variance Swap Payoff vs. Option Vega Sensitivity
2. Realized Vol of Vol Across Time
3. Mean Reversion of Volatility
4. Dynamic Hedging of a Volatility Swap with a Variance Swap
5. Variance Swap Prices against Skewness
6. Backtesting Result for Short Variance Carry
7. Backtesting Result for Roll on Forward Variance Swap
8. Backtesting Result for Buy and Hold Variance Swap
9. Option Gamma for a Spectrum of Options Across Strike
